# Cyclistic
Google Capstone Project using R programming

Cyclistic is a Google capstone project on Data analysis.
I have used data from Sep'20 to Aug'21 for the analysis, 
for the cleaning process I used R programming. 
And the code for cleaning the data is in the RMD file, that I have uploaded here in GITHUB.
